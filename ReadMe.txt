1. To run the entry file and view the application, unzip the application and click/double click on the index.html.

2. My thought process was to first build the markup with HTML and CSS, before adding the relevant functionalities with JavaScript.
   I have all the CSS in one folder to make it easy to locate a file. I did same for the Javascript files.

3. I covered all the requirements to the best of my knowledge. I just could not add comments to my html and css codes for the sake of time.

4. To run the source code properly, follow instruction number one above.

5. The issues I have while completing the assignment were with the mockup on figma. There was no way for me to get the assets/icons I needed.

6. To improve the assignment, users should have access to the assets on the mockup easily and maybe, allowed to implement the assignment with any framework of their choice.
